# Hermes

This is a POC project (still in development) to understand how agents in a multi agent systems can interact with each other.

Current implementation defines an _Agent Layer_, on top of a _Transaction Layer_ which rests on top of a _Storage Layer_. The idea is pretty simple, an agent can be registered on the
transaction layer and request to send messages to other agents (handled by trasaction layer).

_Note_: This is just an experiment, and I'm still working on it so comments are appreciated ðŸ˜ƒ
